                      <p> Wraith’s abilities are centered around her void abilities, allowing her to slip in and out of reality to avoid damage and reposition. All together Wraith’s kit makes her one of the hardest legends to lock down, making her a nightmare to deal with when she’s played by a practiced player. Read up on Wraith’s skills here to get a stronger understanding of what she’s capable of in your matches.</p>
                      <ul>
                         <li> Voices from the Void (Passive) - Wraith players are warned whenever an enemy sights in on you, when a player has you in their scope, when a large number of enemies have died in an area, when there are traps nearby, and when there are a large number of enemies in an area.</li>
                        <li>Into the Void (Tactical) - Slip out of reality after a short delay, becoming immune to damage and increasing your movement speed for a short time before shunting back into reality. Wraith is unable to use weapons or gear shortly before, during, and shortly after void walking.</li>
                        <li>Dimensional Rift (Ultimate) - Tear open a portal into the void and increase your movement speed. Activate again to place another portal at your current location that all players can use to quickly travel between portals.</li>
                      </ul>

                          <p>By using his Grappling Hook, Pathfinder's main ability is to reach the heights no other agent can reach. He can easily reposition in battle without much trouble, which gives him a lot of advantages. Moreover, he has other abilities like Insider Knowledge and Zipline Gun that are awesome skills for supporting the squad.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li> Inside Knowledge (Passive) - It permanently reduces the cooldown of Pathfinder’s ultimate ability by a total of 10 seconds every time you scan the Survey Beacon. That’s precisely why people think this skill is useless; however, amidst fighting, every second can change the tide of the battle. That’s why this skill is a gem for people who want to take advantage of reducing the ultimate’s cooldown time. </li>
                            <li> Grappling Hook (Tactical) - One of the trickiest abilities in the game, Grappling Hook requires next level of self-control and precision. The hook attaches to the nearest object or even a piece of terrain. It then pulls your character towards the target in the fastest way possible. Momentum plays a huge role in the pulling speed, and that’s why this ability is ideal for bailing out from situations that you think will give you a bruising.</li>
                            <li>Zipline (Ultimate) - It provides a lot of mobility to yourself and your team. Using the ultimate will allow you and your team to fire the Zipline Gun at greater distances as long as the zipline is connected to a building or  some other high target. This is a great way to assert dominance and destroy your opponents; and since there are a lot of buildings and terrains all around the Apex Legends maps, this ability can be used almost everywhere.

                            <p>Unlike most Legends in Apex Legends, Bangalore’s toolkit is perhaps the most straightforward for players. Instead of juggling complicated Skills, players can simply smoke their way inside and outside of combat or even end conflicts with a massive tactical ordnance - giving her a kit extremely compatible with powerful weapons such as an Apex Legends Assault Rifle.</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Double Time (Passive) - When Bangalore takes fire, she gets a buff that boosts her sprinting speed, allowing her to get into and out of combat situations much faster than others.
                              </li>
                              <li>Smoke Launcher (Tactical) - Bangalore whips out a Smoke Launcher that launches a Smoke  Canister that explodes into a smoke wall. Players can use this to conceal themselves or force enemies to navigate throughout a cloud of smoke.</li>
                              <li>Rolling Thunder (Ultimate) - When prompted, Bangalore throws a flare that calls forth an artillery strike to her immediate position. Various small missiles land in front of her that slowly detonate.</li>
                            </ul>

                                Compared to other defensive Legends, the straightforward toolkit of Gibraltar allows most players to be able to engage in firefights from a defensive standpoint even with Apex Legends SMGs. Instead of babysitting allies with various abilities, Gibraltar’s all-rounder toolkit provides teammates with enough room to adjust - allowing them to take cover or recover in his dome, or even engaging enemies head-on with a shielded-Gibraltar providing sniper cover. Here’s a quick rundown on what Gibraltar’s kit offers in terms of abilities in Apex Legends. </p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>
                                    Gun Shield (Passive) - Gibraltar’s ADS can be accompanied by a deployable gun shield that gives an extra defense against incoming fire.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>Dome of Protection (Tactical) - Gibraltar throws a disc that projects a shield after landing. This shield stops all incoming and outgoing shots.
</li>
                                  <li>Defensive Bombardment (Ultimate) - The Legend calls forth a concentrated mortar strike on a marked position, usually near Gibraltar’s point of reference.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Being the premiere healer in Apex Legends gameplay, Lifeline is built to ensure the survival of the team. Having a lack of concrete combat skills, players of Lifeline need to be able to balance protecting the team and herself both inside and outside of combat. This can become rather overwhelming for players who aren’t used to a full-support kit, but perfect for teams who want a balance of aggression and safety even with mere Apex Legends SMGs. Players interested in becoming Lifeline need to consider the following skills in her toolkit:</p>
                                <ul>
                                                                  <li>
                                                                    Combat Revive (Passive) - When reviving knocked down allies, Lifeline simply deploys Heal Drone to do it. This leaves Lifeline free to do other tasks while Heal Drone saves her teammate, making Lifeline a more mobile support unit.
                                                                  </li>
                                                                  <li>D.O.C. Heal Drone (Tactical) - Lifeline releases her ever-trusted Heal Drone to heal all players within a particular area. This lasts for 20 seconds, healing 8 Health per second.

                                </li>
                                                                  <li>Care Package (Ultimate) - Lifeline calls in a personal Care Package that almost always contains beneficial support items, ranging from armor, consumables, and even weapon attachments.</li>
                                                                </ul>

                                    There’s a reason Bloodhound is one of the first Legends players of Apex Legends encounter, and this is usually attached to the idea that they’re the game’s most straightforward tracker. Thanks to their toolkit, Bloodhound players can easily spot enemies and even identify minute movements in the map that no one else has access to, making a Bloodhound using an Apex Legends Assault Rifle a force to reckon with. For a brief primer on their abilities.  </p>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>
                                        Tracker (Passive) - Enemies who interact with portions of the map leave various prompts that Bloodhound will comment on, including recently-interacted objects, recent combat areas, and even foot trails and bloodprints. In Season 16: Revelrie, a white raven may appear that leads Bloodhound to the closest set of enemy tracks, allowing players to become more aggressive.

                                      </li>
                                      <li>Eye of the Allfather (Tracker) - Bloodhound activates a scan that reveals the inside of a conical area of effect, highlighting relevant things such as clues, traps, and enemies for a duration. It’s this ability to detect enemies in closed areas that can help Bloodhound become an extremely offensive-oriented gameplay.
                                    </li>
                                      <li>Beast of the Hunt (Ultimate) - Bloodhound taps into a surge of energy that gives them a speed boost as well as sensing tracks of nearby enemies. The same white raven from Tracker appears to lead Bloodhound to enemies, and prolong the duration of the effect after kills.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Mirage isn’t just playful courtesy of his personality. Rather, his jolly and sometimes arrogant personality is reflected in his toolkit, which is heavily reliant on clones - making him ideal for solo Apex Legends gameplay. His sheer dependence on clones can make Mirage a one-trick pony, but this one trick can kill entire squads when used right. Here are his abilities. </p>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>
                                        Now You See Me… (Passive) - When Mirage uses Respawn Beacons to revive allies, he and his allies remain invisible throughout the revival process and a few seconds afterward.

                                      </li>
                                      <li>Psyche Out (Tactical) - Mirage can release a holographic clone that can confuse the enemy. Players can even remotely control the clone by mirroring Mirage’s movements or leave them in an area to leave a decoy for enemies to reveal their positions.

                                    </li>
                                      <li>Life of the Party (Ultimate) - When activated, Mirage uses the full-blown might of his tech to release five (5) decoys that can distract enemies. Players can control all of these clones to do whatever their Mirage is currently doing.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        Perhaps the best thing that sets Caustic apart from other Legends in Apex Legends gameplay would be his primary playstyle: his Gas Traps. Thanks to the deployable nature of these trinkets, Caustic is able to transform even the most mundane of locations into death traps, especially once Caustic and his team finish enemies off with Apex Legends Assault Rifles and other powerful guns. Players who want to get some insights into what Caustic can offer might want to check out these abilities.
                                      </p>

                                          Nox Vision (Passive): Caustic is able to see enemies inside his Gas Traps, giving him a pseudo-tracking role whenever pursuing enemies inside his poisonous smoke cloud.


                                        </li>
                                        <li>Nox Gas Traps (Tactical): Caustic can place up to six (6) Gas Traps that activate as soon as players get close to them or shoot them. This is the core element of his toolkit, as this deals damage over time which, when coupled with a shootout, can quickly wipe out an entire enemy squad.

                                      </li>
                                        <li>Nox Gas Grenade (Ultimate): The Legend can deploy a short-range grenade that unleashes a poisonous cloud over a large area, practically capable of closing off environments from access.</li>

                                          Players who prefer to go wild with high risk, high reward strategies will definitely feel a rush of adrenaline with Octane’s hyper-aggressive kit. After all, he’s the only Legend with the capabilities of outpacing everyone else in the game, encouraging high-speed gameplay. However, despite Octane’s penchant to cause chaos regardless of his choice of weapons like Apex Legends SMGs, it would do good for players who plan on using him to have a more concrete grasp of what his toolkit can offer them. Here is an overview of Octane’s core skills and how they factor into general gameplay:
                                        </p>

                                            Given Wattson’s area-securing toolkit, her skillset isn’t an immediate choice for offensive-leaning players in any Apex Legends map. However, players who love powerful weapons like Machine Guns enjoy sticking behind Wattson’s defensive perimeter and picking off enemies who try to invade their space. Players who appreciate this kind of defensive playstyle should check out Wattson’s toolkit.

                                            Crypto is one of the few Apex Legends characters who is constantly accompanied by a Drone. However, unlike more fast-paced counterparts such as Lifeline and Horizon, Crypto’s usage of his Drone is the hallmark of his rather extremely careful - and sometimes slow - gameplay. This makes it ideal for him to use an Apex Legends Assault Rifle or a quick-firing weapon to help him with sudden engagements. However, players who get to master Crypto get access to one of the most potent surveillance Legends out there, thanks to these abilities:

                                                Neurolink (Passive) - Whenever Crypto releases his Drone for surveillance, everything the Drone marks for up to 30 meters is also detected by his teammates.



                                              </li>
                                              <li>Surveillance Drone (Tactical) - The piece de resistance of Crypto’s kit, he can launch his Drone to explore up to a certain distance. Aside from being able to mark enemies and other useful items, the Drone can use Survey Beacons and Respawn Beacons remotely.



                                            </li>
                                              <li>Drone EMP (Ultimate) - Perhaps Crypto’s most devastating offering, Crypto can load and launch an EMP blast from his drone. Not only does this slow down players and destroy traps, but this also deals 50 Shield damage.</li>
                                            </ul>

       As players begin to learn and master the newly released character there will certainly be a plentiful amount of defeats and deaths. The character's kit is relatively complex and is one that, if not mastered, can lead to some embarrassing and frustrating losses. However, there is no better time to learn a new character than now and even the most frustrating losses can serve as a learning tool for players learning a new character. When picking up Revenant it is important that aspiring players understand his relative strengths and weaknesses. He is a very technical legend and is one that will require a firm understanding of game mechanics to excel with. This guide will provide aspiring players a foundation to build upon as they master the newly released assassin.

                  Given how Apex Legends weapons aren’t immediately available in a gameplay session, players who plan on using Loba might get very attracted with her item-acquisition skillset. However, her toolkit does exclusively focus on detecting and acquiring items, meaning Loba has a distinct lack of combat skills that make her unideal for extremely aggressive players toting Apex Legends SMGs. Gamers who want to use the battle royale’s resident thief need to consider the following skills to maximize her toolkit:
                </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Eye For Quality (Passive) - As a thief, Loba has an impeccable ability to determine the quality of the goods she sees. In the game, this allows her to ping objects inside containers.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Burglar’s Best Friend (Tactical) - Loba throws her bracelet and teleports where it lands or upon command, provided the button is pressed again while it travels in the arc.

                  </li>
                    <li>Black Market Boutique (Ultimate) - Loba activates her staff and reveals a market, allowing anyone to acquire loot from various containers in the vicinity.
</li>
                  </ul>
